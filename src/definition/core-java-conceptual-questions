Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?

a. Java Compiler: Java compiler is javac tool located in /bin folder of the JDK installation directory. It reads class and interface definitions,
   written in the Java programming language, and compiles them into bytecode class files. It can also process annotations in Java source files and classes.

b. Java Interpreter: Java interpreter is used to interpret the .class Java files that have been compiled by Java compiler (javac).
   Java interpreter is accessed using java command. The java command starts a Java application. It does this by starting a Java runtime environment,
   loading a specified class, and calling that class's main method.

c. Java Disassembler: The javap command is the disassembly tool of JDK that disassembles one or more class files. Its output depends on the options used.
   If no options are used, javap prints out the package, protected, and public fields and methods of the classes passed to it. The javap prints its
   output to stdout.

d. Java Header File Generator: Java Header File Generator (javah command-line tool) generates C header and source files that are needed to implement
   native methods.

e. Java Documentation: Java Documentation helps to maintain code. The javadoc tool comes as part of Java Development Kit that parses the declarations
   and documentation comments in a set of Java source files and produces a corresponding set of HTML pages describing the public and protected classes,
   nested classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields. You can use it to generate the API documentation or the implementation documentation
   for a set of source files.

f. Java Debugger: The Java Debugger, jdb, is a simple command-line debugger for Java classes. It is a demonstration of the Java Platform Debugger
   Architecture that provides inspection and debugging of a local or remote Java Virtual Machine.

g. Java Applet Viewer: This is used to view the Java applets. The applet viewer command connects to the documents or resources designated by urls
   and displays each applet referenced by the documents in its own window.


What is IDE?
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and
test software. Typically, an IDE contains a code editor, a compiler or interpreter and a debugger that the developer accesses through
a single graphical user interface (GUI).


What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, Android Studio, Enide Studio 2014, BlueJ, jEdit, jGRASP, JSource, JDeveloper, and DrJava
are the top most popular IDEs available in the market for JAVA.


Explain the entire java life cycle.
 a. The text editor is used to create the high-level Java text file. This file is saved as a .java file on the disk.
 b. We then compile this text file using the Java compiler, which result in a .class file being created on the disk.
 c. The .class file contains the bytecodes. The file is then loaded into memory by the class loader.
 d. The bytecode verifier confirms that the bytecodes are valid and not hostile.
 e. Finally, the JVM reads the bytecodes in memory and translates them into machine code.


What is class?
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors.


What is object?
An object is an instance of a class.


What is the entry point of an application?
The main method is the entry point of a Java application. When JVM is told to run an application by specifying its class,
it will look for the main method.


Why main is static?
You need an entry point into your program. Static means that you can call the function without having to instantiate an object/instance of a class.
That's why main method needs to be static, in order to allow it to be the entry to the program.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
In interface, methods are abstract and cannot be implemented, only can declare variables. But in an abstract class, you can
have abstract and non-abstract methods.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? If not, how do you use it ?
No, you cannot directly make an object from Interface and Abstract class.
But you make concrete class, and then in the concrete class you can extend an abstract class or implement an interface in order to use them.


What is Access Specifier?
Access modifiers (or access specifiers) are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes,
methods, and other members.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. It is a type of programming where programmers define the data type of a data structure and
also the types of operations that can be applied to that data structure.


Features of OOP:
b. Inheritance - When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object
c. Polymorphism - Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms, i.e., when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
a. Encapsulation - Wrapping code and data together into a single unit and declaring the variables of a class as private.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Java API (application programming interface) is a list of all classes that are part of JDK, including all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with their methods and constructors.
Java.util, Java.io, Java.SQL, Java.lang, and Junit.


Does java support multiple inheritance?
No.


What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name, if their argument lists are different.
Overloading happens during compile time.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal flow of instructions.
The code which is prone to exceptions is placed in the try block. When an exception occurs, that exception occurred is handled by
catch block associated with it. ... If an exception occurs in protected code, the catch block (or blocks) that follows the try is checked.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in Java means that the variable or methods is shared between all instances of that class as it belongs to the type,
not the actual objects themselves.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
The final keyword is used to define an variables or methods that can only be assigned once.


What is final, finally and finalize?
a. Final: Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
b. Finally: Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
c. Finalize: Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.


What is a constructor ?
A constructor is a special method of a class or structure that initializes an object.


What is "this" keyword in java ?
"This" keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It can be used to refer current class instance variable,
invoke or initiate a class constructor, or passed as an argument in the method call.


What is "super" keyword in java?
It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class. Only public and protected methods
can be called by the super keyword. It is also used by class constructors to invoke constructors of its parent class.


What is JVM stand for ?
JVM stands for Hava Virtual Machine.


What version of java are you using?
We are using version 8.


What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for Java Archive.


What is compile time and run time?
a. Compile time is the time it takes for the source code to be compiled into machine code in order to become an executable program.
b. Run time is the time it takes for a composite mechanism to provide program execution services.
In Java,  JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides a Java program with all the resources it may need to execute.


What is heap?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap.
The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.


How java manage it's memory?
There are two memory sources, stack memory and heap memory. Stack memory stores primitive types and the addresses of objects.
Heap memory stores the object values.


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable, so if you try to alter their values, another object gets created. But StringBuffer and StringBuilder
are mutable, so they can change their values. Also, thread-Safety is different between StringBuffer and StringBuilder,
StringBuffer is thread-safe but StringBuilder is not.


What is Singleton class?
The Singleton class is a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one does not exist.
If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object. To make sure that the object cannot be instantiated
any other way, the constructor is made private.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database
or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a sequence of bytes is called deserialization.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Int takes more memory.


Why is String Immutable in Java?
String is immutable because if it were mutable, a connection or file would be changed and lead to serious security threat.


What is constructor chaining in Java?
Calling one constructor from other is called Constructor chaining in Java.
Constructors can call each other automatically or explicitly using this() and super() keywords. this()


The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
The serial collector is the simplest one, mainly designed for single-threaded environments and small heaps.
The parallel collector is more efficient than the serial collector, because it is uses multiple threads to scan through
and compact the heap.


What is JIT stands for?
JIT stands for Just In Time.


Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
All objects are allocated on the heap area managed by the JVM. As long as an object is being referenced,
the JVM considers it alive. Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code,
the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No, because it is an automated process and therefore cannot be forced manually.


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
The main difference is that Stack is used for static memory allocation, while Heap for dynamic memory allocation.
